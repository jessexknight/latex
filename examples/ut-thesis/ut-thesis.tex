%% SUMMARY OF FEATURES:
%%
%% All environments, commands, and options provided by the `ut-thesis'
%% class will be described below, at the point where they should appear
%% in the document.  See the file `ut-thesis.cls' for more details.
%%
%% To explicitly set the pagestyle of any blank page inserted with
%% \cleardoublepage, use one of \clearemptydoublepage,
%% \clearplaindoublepage, \clearthesisdoublepage, or
%% \clearstandarddoublepage (to use the style currently in effect).
%%
%% For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%% `longquotation' environments.


%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  - Default settings format a final copy (single-sided, normal
%%    margins, one-and-a-half-spaced with single-spaced notes).
%%  - For a rough copy (double-sided, normal margins, double-spaced,
%%    with the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use
%%    the `draft' option.
%%  - The default global line spacing can be changed with one of the
%%    options `singlespaced', `onehalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.
%%  - Footnotes and marginal notes are all single-spaced by default, but
%%    can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document
%%    by using the option `standardspacednotes'.
%%  - The size of the margins can be changed with one of the options:
%%     . `narrowmargins' (1 1/4" left, 3/4" others),
%%     . `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%%     . `widemargins' (1 1/4" all),
%%     . `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).
%%  - The pagestyle of "cleared" pages (empty pages inserted in
%%    two-sided documents to put the next page on the right-hand side)
%%    can be set with one of the options `cleardoublepagestyleempty',
%%    `cleardoublepagestyleplain', or `cleardoublepagestylestandard'.
%%  - Any other standard option for the `report' document class can be
%%    used to override the default or draft settings (such as `10pt',
%%    `11pt', `12pt'), and standard LaTeX packages can be used to
%%    further customize the layout and/or formatting of the document.

%% *** Add any desired options. ***
\documentclass{ut-thesis}

%% *** Add \usepackage declarations here. ***
%% The standard packages `geometry' and `setspace' are already loaded by
%% `ut-thesis' -- see their documentation for details of the features
%% they provide.  In particular, you may use the \geometry command here
%% to adjust the margins if none of the ut-thesis options are suitable
%% (see the `geometry' package for details).  You may also use the
%% \setstretch command to set the line spacing to a value other than
%% single, one-and-a-half, or double spaced (see the `setspace' package
%% for details).

%% *** NOTE ***
%% Put here all other formatting commands that belong in the preamble.
%% In particular, you should put all of your \newcommand's,
%% \newenvironment's, \newtheorem's, etc. (in other words, all the
%% global definitions that you will need throughout your thesis) in a
%% separate file and use "\input{filename}" to input it here.


%% *** Adjust the following settings as desired. ***

%% List only down to subsections in the table of contents;
%% 0=chapter, 1=section, 2=subsection, 3=subsubsection, etc.
\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}

%% Make each page fill up the entire page.
\flushbottom


%%%%%%%%%%%%      MAIN  DOCUMENT      %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.
%% However, if your document is two-sided and you want the abstract
%% _not_ to appear on the back of the title page, then uncomment the
%% following line.
%\cleardoublepage

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
  Here is the abstract
%% *** Put your Abstract here. ***
%% (At most 150 words for M.Sc. or 350 words for Ph.D.)
\end{abstract}

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage and
%% the table of contents starts with \clearpage.  Use \cleardoublepage
%% for anything that you want to appear on a right-hand page.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed -- just a paragraph
%% formatted flush right (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\begin{dedication}
  hello world
% *** Put your Dedication here. ***
\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% uncomment the following line.
%\newpage  % separate pages for dedication and acknowledgements

%% Alternatively, if you leave both on the same page, it is probably a
%% good idea to add a bit of extra vertical space in between the two --
%% for example, as follows (adjust as desired).
\vspace{.5in}  % vertical space between dedication and acknowledgements

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\begin{acknowledgements}
  Thanks Mom
% *** Put your Acknowledgements here. ***
\end{acknowledgements}

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\tableofcontents

%% This generates the List of Tables (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\listoftables

%% This generates the List of Figures (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\listoffigures

%% You can add commands here to generate any other material that belongs
%% in the head matter (for example, List of Plates, Index of Symbols, or
%% List of Appendices).

%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.
\end{preliminary}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep     %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files.     %%
%%  Each chapter file should start with "\chapter{ChapterName}".      %%
%%  Note that using `\include' instead of `\input' will make each     %%
%%  chapter start on a new page, and allow you to format only parts   %%
%%  of your thesis at a time by using `\includeonly'.                 %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\input{intro.tex}


%% This adds a line for the Bibliography in the Table of Contents.
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
%% *** Set the bibliography style. ***
%% (change according to your preference/requirements)
\bibliographystyle{plain}
%% *** Set the bibliography file. ***
%% ("thesis.bib" by default; change as needed)
\bibliography{thesis}

%% *** NOTE ***
%% If you don't use bibliography files, comment out the previous line
%% and use \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}.  (In that
%% case, you should probably put the bibliography in a separate file and
%% `\include' or `\input' it here).
