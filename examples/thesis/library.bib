  abstract = {A probabilistic framework is presented that enables
  image registration, tissue classification, and bias correction
  to be combined within the same generative model.
  A derivation of a log-likelihood objective function
  for the unified model is provided.
  The model is based on a mixture of Gaussians and is extended to incorporate
  a smooth intensity variation and nonlinear registration with tissue probability maps.
  A strategy for optimising the model parameters is described,
  along with the requisite partial derivatives of the objective function.},
