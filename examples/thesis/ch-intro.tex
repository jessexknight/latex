\chapter{Introduction}
In this chapter we introduce \LaTeX.
\section{Comparison vs. Microsoft Word}
\LaTeX\ is an alternative to MS Word.
It's not better in every situation (Figure \ref{fig:latex-vs-word}),
but for large, complicated, or math-heavy documents,
its undeniably better.

\par
The major paradigm shift when transitioning from MS Word to \LaTeX\ is that
you do not see the final product while you are typing.
Instead, the document is \textit{compiled},
producing a PDF document directly.
\par
This allows more complex document creation,
without trying to resolve all links as you type.
For example, the Table of Contents for this document is generated automatically using
\lstinline|\tableofcontents|.
\section{Components}
\subsection{Commands}
In \LaTeX, all commands are preceded by a backslash: \lstinline|\|.
Not all commands accept arguments, but when they do, you must supply all of them,
and enclose each in braces: \lstinline|{...}|.
For example, \lstinline|$\frac{1}{2}$| produces $\frac{1}{2}$ (more on the \lstinline|$| later).
\par
You can create your own commands using:
\lstinline|\newcommand{\cmd}{definition}|,
which you could use as:
\lstinline|my command is: \cmd|,
producing:
``my command is: definition''.
If you want your command to use arguments, the syntax is:
\lstinline|\newcommand{\cmd}[1]{You provided the argument: #1}|,
for which
\lstinline|\cmd{apples}|
produces
``You provided the argument: apples''.
\subsection{Packages}
\LaTeX\ doesn't always have all the tools we need.
We'll often need to import user-created packages to do some fancy stuff,
like embedding images, creating flow-charts, etc.
To do this, we use:\\
\lstinline|\usepackage{packagename}|.
This will provide us additional commands that we can use to create our document.
You must load packages in the document header.
\subsection{Hello World}
What is the document header, you ask?
Let's look at a minimal working example.
This code produces a document containing only the words ``hello world!'':
\begin{lstlisting}
  \documentclass{article}
  % load packages here
  \begin{document}
    % document content here
    hello world!
  \end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
The \lstinline|\documentclass| command specifies the type of document,
while the rendered contents of the document are enclosed in
\lstinline|\begin{document} ... \end{document}|.
Comments can be added using \lstinline|%|.
